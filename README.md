#### Total Points 
* 100 (One Hundred)

## Goal
In this assignment you will be asked to implement a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) with [MNIST data set](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). This project will be completed in Python 3 using [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/).

## Project Guidelines

#### Data set

MNIST is a dataset composed of handwritten numbers and their labels. Each MNIST image is a 28\*28 grey-scale image, which is labeled with an integer value between 0 and 9, corresponding to the actual value in the image. MNIST is provided in Pytorch as 28\*28 matrices containing numbers ranging from 0 to 255. There are 60000 images and labels in the training data set and 10000 images and labels in the test data set. Since this project is an unsupervised learning project, you can only use the 60000 images for your training. 

Download MNIST dataset directly in Pytorch:

```python
from torchvision import datasets

mnist_trainset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=None)
mnist_testset = datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=None)
```

#### Installing Software and Dependencies 

* [Install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)
* [Create virtual environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
* Install packages (e.g. pip install torch)

#### Building and Compiling Generator and Discriminator

In Pytorch, you can try different layers, such as “Conv2D”, and different activation functions, such as “tanh”, and “leakyRelu”. You can apply different optimizers, such as stochastic gradient descent or Adam, and different loss functions. The following is the sample code of how to build the model.


```python
# Create a Generator class.
class Generator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ):
        super(Generator, self).__init__()
        # Define your network architecture.

    def forward(self, x):
        # Define your network data flow. 
        return output
# Create a Generator.
netG = Generator(*args)

# Create a Discriminator class.
class Discriminator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ):
        super(Discriminator, self).__init__()
        # Define your network architecture.

    def forward(self, x):
        # Define your network data flow. 
        return output
# Create a Discriminator.
netD = Discriminator(*args)

# Setup Generator optimizer.
optimizerG = torch.optim.Adam(netG.parameters(), lr=0.0002, betas=(0.9, 0.999))

# Setup Discriminator optimizer.
optimizerD = torch.optim.Adam(netD.parameters(), lr=0.0002, betas=(0.9, 0.999))

# Define loss function. 
criterion = torch.nn.BCELoss()
```

#### Training GAN

You have the option of changing how many epochs to train your model for and how large your batch size is. The following is the sample code of how to train GAN. You can add self-defined parameters such as #epoch, learning rate scheduler to the train function.



```python
# Training
def train():
    for _ in range(batchCount):  
	
        # Create a batch by drawing random index numbers from the training set
       
        # Create noise vectors for the generator
        
        # Generate the images from the noise

        # Create labels

        # Train discriminator on generated images

        # Train generator

```

#### Saving Generator

Please use the following code to save the model and weights of your generator.



```python
# save model with Pytorch
torch.save(netG, './generator.pt')
torch.save(netG.state_dict(), './generator_weights.pt')
```

#### Plotting

Please use the following code to plot the generated images. As for the loss plot of your generator and discriminator during the training, you can plot with your own style. 


```python
# Generate images
np.random.seed(504)
h = w = 28
num_gen = 25

z = np.random.normal(size=[num_gen, z_dim])
generated_images = netG(z)

# plot of generation
n = np.sqrt(num_gen).astype(np.int32)
I_generated = np.empty((h*n, w*n))
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        I_generated[i*h:(i+1)*h, j*w:(j+1)*w] = generated_images[i*n+j, :].reshape(28, 28)

plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))
plt.axis("off")
plt.imshow(I_generated, cmap='gray')
plt.show()
```

## Deliverables

Please compress all the below files into a zipped file and submit the zip file (firstName_lastName_GAN.zip) to Canvas. 

#### PDF Report
* Set of Experiments Performed: Include a section describing the set of experiments that you performed, what structures you experimented with (i.e., number of layers, number of neurons in each layer), what hyperparameters you varied (e.g., number of epochs of training, batch size, and any other parameter values, weight initialization schema, activation function), what kind of loss function you used and what kind of optimizer you used. 
* Special skills: Include the skills that can improve the generation quality. Here are some [tips](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks) that may help.   
* Visualization: Include 25 (5\*5) final generated images which are formatted as the example in Goal and a loss plot of the generator and discriminator during your training. For generated images, you need to generate at least one image for each digit. 

#### Python code
* Include model creation, model training, and plotting code.

#### Generator Model
* Turn in your best generator saved as “generator.pt” and the weights of your generator saved as “generator_weights.pt”.


## Grading

#### Report (70%)

* Set of experiments performed: 30 points
* Special skills: 20 points
* Visualization: 20 points

#### Code (20%) 

To achieve full marks for the coding portion of your assignment, it's crucial that your submitted scripts are operational. This entails that upon testing with a small dataset, your code must execute flawlessly, demonstrating its ability to generate images as intended.

###### Evaluation Process:

We will use an evaluation.py script to assess the functionality of your code. This script, designed to test your code's image generation capabilities, will be run using a sample dataset. A sample of the evaluation.py script is made available.

###### Flexibility with the Sample Code:

While the provided sample of evaluation.py serves as a guideline for how your code will be evaluated, you are encouraged to modify this script as necessary to suit your code's requirements.

###### Criteria for Full Credits:

Functionality: Your submission must run without errors and generate images correctly when tested with the evaluation script, whether it's the original or a modified version of evaluation.py. Otherwise, you may lose some points based on your error. These are recommendations for a Successful Submission:

* Code Clarity: Ensure your code is well-commented and organized.
* Include Dependencies: Verify that all necessary files and dependencies are included in your submission to prevent runtime errors.

#### Model (10%)

You can get full credits if all the generated images can be recognized, otherwise, you may lose some points. Also, the code you submitted should be able to generate all 10 different digits.

## Bonus (10 points)
